# Analyze-Traffic-Patterns
## Project Goal
This project aims to analyze traffic patterns using data mining techniques to understand better and predict traffic congestion in urban areas. By identifying the most significant predictors of traffic volume and congestion, we can assist in transportation planning and congestion management, ultimately contributing to developing more efficient and sustainable cities. We expect to model the traffic flow and accurately predict congestion levels based on the available data.
